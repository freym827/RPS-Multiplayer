Multiplayer rock paper scissors using firebase to store choices. This app is a work in progress, though still currently offering
basic capabilities. 

Two players can join at a time, each in their own window. Those two players can play rock paper scissors, or 
send messages to each other. For future development there are some bug fixes and overall design necessities to be implemented.
